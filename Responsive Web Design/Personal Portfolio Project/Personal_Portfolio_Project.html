        <p id="yoursite">The websites I design <b>prioritize the user</b>. I focus on accessibility, ease of access, and
          functionality. Many modern day websites are flashy and difficult to navigate. My goal is for the user to be
          able to find the information they need quickly and efficiently.</p>
        <p id="skills">
          I am certified in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I have experience working with many other
          languages as well. I am still ongoing with my studies, but I am eager to get to work. I am able to work
          remotely.

      <h3>Backstory</h3><img id="selfie" src="selfie.jpg" alt="this is me" />
      <p>I am 29 years old, crafting web pages from Spokane, Washington. As I grew up I was told I could be anything I
        wanted, as I'm sure many others were. My grandparents were the ones to first share this famous Aristotle quote
        with me. I realize more and more each day that they were right more often than I gave them credit for.</p><br>
      <p>My mom studied web design while I was growing up in the 90's. She would get excited to learn something new and
        want to share it, so I spent a lot of my childhood learning HTML. In my teens, social media sites became very
        popular. My knowledge was continued by making sure I created Myspace pages for my friends.</p><br>
      <p>As a young adult I worked an eclectic variety of jobs. A few examples include caring for dogs at a dog boarding
        school, arranging flowers at a florist shop, to waiting tables at a retirement community, and eventually
        becoming a nursing assistant.</p><br>
      <p>A long story later I left the medical field and fell into owning a fairly successful home remodeling company. I
        managed a small group of hard working people doing full scale remodels in Spokane for a couple of years. Then
        the COVID-19 shutdown happened.</p><br>
      <p>I have always put everything I have into the work I do, yet with each job I'd find myself growing more
        exhausted of it as time went on. I have come to realize that code, to me, is what his quote is talking about.
