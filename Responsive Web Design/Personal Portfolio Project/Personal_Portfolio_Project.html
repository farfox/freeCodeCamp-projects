Hello! My name's Taigen Graham. If you're on this page, it's likely you may be seeking a web developer. Look no further.
  </h1>
  <span>I'm currently proficient with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, and SCSS.</span>
  <span>Before web design I worked a variety of fields. I was started working at a dog daycare in Bothell, WA. I went on to become a florist, then a cook, a CNA, to owning a home remodeling company. When COVID-19 hit the U.S., work slowed down and I had to get creative. Though I've held many types of jobs, code was always something that I continued to do throughout my life. I started learning HTML as an adolescent and now I'm eager to make a career out of it. </span>
  <h2>Shown below are some projects I have created</h2>
